# Vi3W — Democratizing 3D for Everyone

> **Create, edit, and iterate on 3D models using plain language.**  
> No CAD. No GPUs. No weeks of training.

[![Vi3W Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/oGOkx7cuwvo/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOkx7cuwvo)

Vi3W is an AI-powered **text-to-3D generation and editing system** built with **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini 3 Pro**.  
Its single goal: **make 3D creation as accessible as writing text**.

## 🚀 Why Vi3W?

3D powers almost every major industry today:

- 🌍 Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- 🏥 Healthcare & Surgical Planning
- 🏭 Manufacturing & 3D Printing
- 🎮 Gaming & Simulation
- 🛒 E-commerce & AR
- 🤖 Robotics & Digital Twins

Yet creating 3D is still:

- ❌ Manual and slow  
- ❌ Skill-heavy  
- ❌ Hardware-expensive  
- ❌ Locked behind complex, outdated tools  

Learning 3D often requires expensive machines, complex software, and weeks (or months) of training.  
There is still **no scalable, end-to-end automated 3D creation workflow**.

**Vi3W fixes this.**

## ✨ What Vi3W Does

Vi3W lets you **generate and edit 3D models using natural language**.

You can:
- Describe a 3D object in plain text
- Optionally provide reference images
- Generate structured 3D geometry
- Edit models **part-by-part** using conversation
- Iterate without rebuilding from scratch

All inside a **simple web interface**.

## 🧠 How It Works

Vi3W treats 3D creation as a **reasoning problem**, not a sculpting task.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Gemini 3 Pro (Google AI Studio)**  
   - Multimodal understanding (text + images)  
   - Interprets user intent  
   - Generates parametric 3D instructions  

2. **Python Geometry Pipeline**  
   - Converts instructions into structured 3D geometry  
   - Optimizes meshes / voxel representations  
   - Enables iterative, part-level editing  

3. **Web Viewer (React + Three.js)**  
   - Real-time 3D visualization  
   - Interactive inspection and refinement  
   - Conversational editing loop  

This setup supports both **generation and iteration**, instead of one-shot outputs.

## 🧪 Built With

- **Gemini 3 Pro** — reasoning & multimodal intelligence  
- **Google AI Studio** — orchestration  
- **ANTIGRAVITY** — rapid prototyping & vibe coding  
- **Python** — geometry and generation pipeline  
- **React** — frontend  
- **Three.js** — real-time 3D rendering  

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Accessibility first** — no CAD or 3D expertise required  
- **Browser-native** — no heavy installs  
- **Prompt-first workflows** — language over sliders  
- **Iterative by default** — edit, don’t restart  
- **Low friction** — fast feedback loops  

---

## 🌍 Who Is This For?

- Students exploring 3D for the first time  
- Developers needing quick 3D assets  
- Designers & creators prototyping ideas  
- Startups building AR / 3D workflows  
- Researchers experimenting with generative geometry  

If you can write text, you can create 3D.

---

## 🔮 Vision

Vi3W is a step toward a future where:

> **Creating 3D is as intuitive as writing a sentence.**

Generative AI has already transformed text, images, and video.  
3D is next—and it shouldn’t remain an expert-only skill.
